# Project Title

JavaScript Password Generator

# Project Description

The application is a random password generator. When the user clicks the 'generate password' button, they are met with prompts to choose the password length, and whether or not they want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters.

The technologies used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Some challenges I faced when building this application were getting mixed up in all my variable names, and knowing when to create a function or a for loop. To over-come this challenge, I broke the goal down into tiny steps, and figured out what I needed to be done. Once I knew what needed to be done, I was able to think of JavaScript techniques that could give me the required outcome.

# Deployment

The web application can be accessed via the deployed GitHub pages link: https://thomasszentirmay.github.io/js-password-generator/

# Usage

Once the web application has been loaded, the user simply needs to click the 'generate password' button on screen, and follow the prompts that appear.

# Credits

This project was guided in class by lead instructor JD Tadlock. We went through all the basic tools necessary to build the application, and how to do the same thing in different ways in JavaScript.

Along with instructor mentoring, ChatGPT was a fantastic resource to share my code with, and to help me fix any required bugs, or to help me fill in code that would make the application run the neccessary way. With every line of code I received from ChatGPT, I also then asked for an extensive explantion of it's effect and what it is doing to the application, to make sure that I wasn't just copying and pasting random code, and that I actually understood the program line for line!
